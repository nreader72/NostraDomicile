# NostraDomicile
The goal of the NostraDomicile Project is to create a web application whose two main functions are to predict whether a house will sell in a specific area based on the homeâ€™s attributes, and given a zip code, what are the most important factors leading to a sale in that area.

NostraDomicile will accomplish this goal by retrieving and storing housing market information using a Zillow API and MySQL database, using machine learning to evaluate housing data and determine factors influencing home sales in a particular area, and creating a user-friendly interface for users to view data about factors influencing home sales and create data visualizations about houses on the market based on user preferences

## Requirements:
* Zillow account to obtain Zillow API ID
* PyZillow Module to utilize API
* Server on local host or hosting service(We use AWS)
* MySQL Relational Database(Also hosted on AWS)
