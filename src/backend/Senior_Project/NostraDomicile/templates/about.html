          <div class="panel-body"><p>The goal of the NostraDomicile Project is to create a web application whose two main functions
             are to predict whether a house will sell in a specific area based on the homeâ€™s attributes, and given a zip
             code, what are the most important factors leading to a sale in that area.</p>

             <p>NostraDomicile will accomplish this
              goal by retrieving and storing housing market information using a Zillow API and MySQL database, using
             machine learning to evaluate housing data and determine factors influencing home sales in a particular area,
              and creating a user-friendly interface for users to view data about factors influencing home sales and
             create data visualizations about houses on the market based on user preferences'</p></div>
